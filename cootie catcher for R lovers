# This code came out of an assignment in which the professor gave us a .txt file 'paper' and we had to practice
# writing functions in R. The last question was "surprise me" and so that we did. The function accepts a few parameters
# feel free to add what ever you like, or change the fortunes. Could make this more complex in the future by adding
# multiple levels of choosing, etc.
